2020-2021 Portfolio

Using this space as the home base for your portfolio, make a wiki or pages like this read me to highlight what you have learned / created over this semester of class. You should consider this as much for your grade as your resume. You've got incredible work to highlight and brag about - do that here. 

I'd like you to consider this assignment as a way to get a job / internship / independent contract with someone outside the school.

Create links to group projects (create a new repo for completed apps) you've been working on, making sure the read me's have details about what the apps do in the format the app store asks - look at a couple apps to see what I'm talking about. Don't forget about those first simple apps you created - they still matter!

AP CSP Create App - TxtAdventure.aia

In this project I utilized my skills and knowledge of MIT App Inventor as well as general computer science information that I had recently learned to create an app that displayed all of my expertise. In it, you explore an old cabin in the middle of the woods and solve simple puzzles to progress. It is the first fully-functioning app I have made.

### 2018-2019
AP Java Group Project - [Bear-Brawl](https://lifedrain28.itch.io/bear-brawl)

In this project I worked with a team to create a game that was easy and fun. I primarily worked on developing and implementing background music and also assisted with stage creation.

### 2020-2021
iOS App Development Project - [Stratagem](https://github.com/Stratagem-Studios/Stratagem)

In this project I worked with a group of students to create an app that we successfully uploaded to the AppStore. For the most part, I managed the app's TestFlight and AppStore Connect pages in order to properly test and upload the app. In addition, I worked on marketing and promoting the app and on developing the app icon.
